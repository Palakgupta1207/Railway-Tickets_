# ***Railway Ticket Booking System***

---

# *1. Problem Statement :*

Booking a railway ticket usually involves sharing your travel details, choosing the right coach, and knowing how much the ticket will cost. When done manually, this process can be slow and mistakes may happen—like choosing the wrong coach or calculating the fare incorrectly.

Therefore this project aims to create a simple Python program that makes the booking process easier. It asks the user for passenger details, travel information, shows the available coach options, checks whether the selected coach is valid, and finally generates a neat ticket summary with the total fare.

# *2. Scope of the Project :*

This project focuses on building a small, easy-to-use ticket booking system through the code:

Asking the passenger for essential personal, travel details (name, age, stations, train number, train name).

Displaying a list of available coaches along with their fixed prices.

Allowing the user to choose a coach and checking if it exists.

Calculating the fare based on the selected coach.

Showing a well-formed ticket with all the entered details.

# *4. High-Level Features :*

Here are the main features of the program :

* Easy User Interaction

The system guides the user step-by-step to enter all required details.

* List of Coaches with Fixed Prices

The program clearly shows all available coach options so the user can choose easily in their budget.

It checks whether the coach selected by the user actually exists or not.

Automatic Fare Calculation

Once the coach is selected, the program finds the correct fare instantly using a dictionary mentioned in the code.

* Clear Ticket Output

After gathering everything, the program prints a clean and readable ticket that includes the following details:

Passenger name and age

Starting and destination stations

Train number and train name

Selected coach

Final fare

* Error Message for Wrong Input

If the user chooses a coach that doesn’t exist, the program gently notifies them and asks them to try again
